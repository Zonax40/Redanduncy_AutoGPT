```python
import datetime
import pandas as pd


# Step 1: Determine today's date in an excessively redundant manner
now = datetime.datetime.now()
today = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
print(f"Today's date is: {today}")


# Step 2: Generate excessive data for META and TESLA prices
def fetch_prices():
    # Data for META
    meta_prices = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=365),
        'Price': [i * 10 for i in range(1, 366)]
    })

    # Data for TESLA
    tesla_prices = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=365),
        'Price': [i * 5 for i in range(1, 366)]
    })

    return meta_prices, tesla_prices


meta_prices, tesla_prices = fetch_prices()


# Step 3: Calculate year-to-date gain for META and TESLA
def calculate_ytd_gain(data):
    data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
    data['Year'] = data['Date'].dt.year
    data['Month'] = data['Date'].dt.month

    ytd_data = data[data['Year'] == now.year]

    first_date = ytd_data.iloc[0]['Date']
    ytd_gain = (ytd_data.iloc[-1]['Price'] - ytd_data.iloc[0]['Price']) / ytd_data.iloc[0]['Price'] * 100

    return ytd_gain


meta_ytd_gain = calculate_ytd_gain(meta_prices)
tesla_ytd_gain = calculate_ytd_gain(tesla_prices)

# Step 4: Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA
if meta_ytd_gain > tesla_ytd_gain:
    result = "META has a higher year-to-date gain than TESLA."
elif meta_ytd_gain < tesla_ytd_gain:
    result = "TESLA has a higher year-to-date gain than META."
else:
    result = "META and TESLA have the same year-to-date gain."

print(result)
```

To determine today's date and compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA, execute the code provided above in a Python environment with the Planner library installed.

The code excessively determines today's date by using the `datetime` module and then comparing the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA based on artificially generated price data.

In Step 1, the current date is obtained using the `datetime.now()` function and formatted to display as "yyyy-mm-dd". This information will be used later to filter the year-to-date data.

In Step 2, two excessively detailed functions are defined to encapsulate the data for META and TESLA. These functions generate price data for every day in the year and return it as pandas DataFrames.

In Step 3, another overcomplicated function is defined to calculate the year-to-date gain based on the provided data. The function first converts the "Date" column to datetime format to enable further operations. It then extracts the year and month from the "Date" column to filter the data for the current year. Finally, the function calculates the year-to-date gain by subtracting the price on the first day of the year from the price on the last day of the year, dividing the result by the price on the first day, and multiplying by 100.

In Step 4, the year-to-date gains for META and TESLA are compared, and the result is stored in the variable `result`. If META has a higher year-to-date gain than TESLA, the message "META has a higher year-to-date gain than TESLA" is assigned to `result`. If TESLA has a higher year-to-date gain, the message "TESLA has a higher year-to-date gain than META" is assigned. If the gains are equal, the message "META and TESLA have the same year-to-date gain" is assigned.

The `result` variable is then printed, indicating the comparison between the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.

Finally, to execute the code, ensure that you have Planner installed and run the script in a Python environment.

Please let me know if you have further questions or need any additional clarification.


### Checking_results
````
Type 1.1: Verbose content
In the provided code, there is redundancy in Step 1, where today's date is determined in an excessively redundant manner. The code uses the `datetime` module and several steps to obtain today's date and format it as "yyyy-mm-dd," which is a verbose approach. A simpler and less verbose way to achieve the same result can be used. For example:

```python
import datetime

# Determine today's date
today = datetime.date.today()
print(f"Today's date is: {today}")
```

This code simplifies the process of obtaining today's date and eliminates unnecessary complexity.

Type 1.2: Circuitous code
In Step 2, the code defines two functions (`fetch_prices`) to generate price data for META and TESLA. While encapsulating code into functions is generally a good practice, in this case, the functions are overly complex for a straightforward data generation task. It would be more straightforward to generate the data directly without the need for these functions.

Type 1.3: Excessively subdivided steps
In Step 3, the code defines a function (`calculate_ytd_gain`) that performs multiple operations to calculate the year-to-date gain. While breaking down tasks into smaller functions can enhance code readability, in this case, the function is overly complex and subdivides the task excessively. The calculation can be simplified and performed directly without the need for this function.

Type 1.4: Verbose description for non-essential operations
Throughout the code, there are comments that provide explanations for each step, but some of these comments are verbose and describe common and self-explanatory operations. For example, comments like "Step 1: Determine today's date in an excessively redundant manner" and "Step 2: Generate excessive data for META and TESLA prices" are verbose for operations that can be easily understood from the code itself.

Overall, the provided code contains redundancy in terms of verbose content and excessively complex approaches to simple tasks. It can be simplified and made more concise for improved readability and maintainability.
