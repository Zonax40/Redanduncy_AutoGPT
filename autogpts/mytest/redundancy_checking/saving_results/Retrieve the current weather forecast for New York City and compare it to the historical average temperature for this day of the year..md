Redundancy includes several major categories, and each major category of redundancy contains several minor subcategories. The specific classification is as follows followed by some detailed examples delimited by triple quotes:
    Major Category 1: Verbose content.
    Minor Subcategory 1.1: long-winded expression.
    Example 1:
    '''
    To embark upon the endeavor of time-to-seconds conversion, one must first attempt to grasp the temporal unit's fundamental components, including the constituent hours, minutes, and seconds. It is then incumbent upon the individual to engage in mathematical computations that involve the multiplication of the hours by the number of seconds contained within an hour, likewise for the minutes, with subsequent addition of these products. This rather intricate process, when pursued with due diligence, culminates in the achievement of temporal measurement quantified in seconds, thus enabling the temporal representation in a standard unit of measurement.
    '''
    In example 1, The text is long-winded and uses excessively complex language to describe a relatively straightforward process. It could be significantly simplified while still conveying the same information.
    Minor Subcategory 1.2: 
    Example 2: Circuitous code.
    '''
    def convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        # A very circuitous way to convert time to seconds
        seconds_in_a_minute = 60
        seconds_in_an_hour = 60 * seconds_in_a_minute
        
        total_seconds = 0

        for i in range(minutes):
            total_seconds += seconds_in_a_minute
        
        total_seconds += seconds
        
        return total_seconds
    '''
    In example 2, the convert_time_to_seconds function is circuitous because instead of directly multiplying hours, minutes, and seconds by their respective factors, the code uses loops to iterate through the components and add the appropriate number of seconds for each component. This creates a more circuitous path to achieve the same result.
    Minor subcategory 1.3: Excessively subdivided steps.
    Example 3:
    '''
    def calculate_hours_to_seconds(hours):
        return hours * 3600

        return hours_in_seconds + minutes_in_seconds + seconds

    total_seconds = calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    '''
    In example 3, the code is excessively subdivided because it breaks down a relatively simple task into multiple smaller functions and steps as the seconds calculating is straightforward.
    Minor subcategory 1.4: Verbose description for non-essential operations. 
    Example 4:

To retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City, we can make use of the OpenWeatherMap API. We will need to send a request to their API endpoint for weather data and extract the relevant information.

First, let's gather some redundant information about the current date and time.

```python
import datetime

current_date = datetime.datetime.now().date()
current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()

print("The current date is:", current_date)
print("The current time is:", current_time)
```

Now that we have performed unnecessary time calculations, let's proceed with acquiring the weather forecast for New York City. Since the OpenWeatherMap API requires an API key, let's generate one and prepare our request.

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
CITY = "New York"
COUNTRY = "US"

# prepare the API URL
url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY},{COUNTRY}&appid={API_KEY}"

# send the request to the API endpoint
response = requests.get(url)
```

Now that we have diligently sent our request to the API, we can extract the relevant weather information from the response.

```python
import json

# convert the response content into a JSON format
data = response.json()

# extract the current temperature from the data
current_temperature = data['main']['temp']

print("The current temperature in New York City is:", current_temperature)
```

Now that we have successfully obtained the current temperature in New York City, let's move on to retrieving the historical average temperature for this day of the year. We will need to access historical weather data from a suitable weather archive. Since we don't have access to a local archive, let's search for an online source where we can find historical weather data for New York City.

```python
search_query = "historical weather data New York City"
search_results = perform_search(search_query)

# Let's inspect the search results to find a suitable source for historical weather data.
print("Search Results:")
for result in search_results:
    print(result.title, "-", result.url)
```

Now, let's say we found a suitable online source for historical weather data in New York City. We will navigate to the website, select the applicable date range, choose the desired weather parameters (such as temperature), and download the data in a suitable format (such as CSV or JSON). We will then process the downloaded file to extract the historical average temperature for this day of the year.

Since we don't have access to select and download historical weather data from an online source directly, I will simulate this step by assuming we have downloaded a file named "historical_weather.csv" containing the necessary data. Let's parse the file and extract the historical average temperature.

```python
import csv

file_path = "historical_weather.csv"

# Read the CSV file
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    
    # Skip the header row
    next(reader)
    
    # Initialize variables
    total_temperature = 0
    count_temperature = 0
    
    # Iterate through each row in the CSV file
    for row in reader:
        # Extract the temperature value from the row (assuming it is in the second column)
        temperature = float(row[1])
        
        # Add the temperature to the total
        total_temperature += temperature
        
        # Increment the temperature count
        count_temperature += 1

# Calculate the historical average temperature
historical_average_temperature = total_temperature / count_temperature

print("The historical average temperature for this day of the year in New York City is:", historical_average_temperature)
```

Finally, let's compare the current temperature to the historical average temperature and provide a conclusion based on the comparison.

```python
# Determine if the current temperature is higher, lower, or equal to the historical average temperature
if current_temperature > historical_average_temperature:
    conclusion = "The current temperature in New York City is higher than the historical average temperature."
elif current_temperature < historical_average_temperature:
    conclusion = "The current temperature in New York City is lower than the historical average temperature."
else:
    conclusion = "The current temperature in New York City is equal to the historical average temperature."

print(conclusion)
```

In summary, we have retrieved the current weather forecast for New York City, obtained the historical average temperature for this day of the year, and compared the two temperatures to draw a conclusion. Although we took a convoluted and lengthy approach, we have successfully completed the task.

To retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year, we will use Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. 

Please note that the code provided may seem excessively verbose and convoluted, but that is intentional to follow the guidelines of this assignment.

To get started, we need to install the `requests` library, which will allow us to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. We will also need an API key, which you can obtain by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website.

```python
# Installing the requests library
!pip install requests
```

Once the library is installed and we have obtained our API key, let's proceed with retrieving the current weather forecast for New York City.

```python
import requests

api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
city = "New York City"

# Construct the URL for the API request
url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()

    # Extract the temperature from the response
    temperature = data["main"]["temp"]

    print(f"The current temperature in {city} is {temperature}°C")
else:
    print("Error occurred while retrieving the weather forecast")
```

Let's move on to comparing the current temperature to the historical average temperature for this day of the year. To obtain historical weather data, we can use the World Weather Online Historical Weather API. Again, we will need to sign up on their website to obtain an API key.

```python
# Installing the wwo-hist library
!pip install wwo-hist

from wwo_hist import retrieve_hist_data

api_key = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
location = city
start_date = "2021-01-01"
end_date = "2021-12-31"
frequency = 24  # 24-hourly data

# Make the API request
hist_weather_data = retrieve_hist_data(
    api_key,
    location,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    frequency,
    location_label=False,
    export_csv=False,
)

# Extract the historical average temperature for today's date
historical_temperature = hist_weather_data.loc[hist_weather_data.index.date == today.date(), "tempC"].mean()

print(f"The historical average temperature for today in {city} is {historical_temperature}°C")
```

Now that we have obtained the current temperature and the historical average temperature for today, let's perform the comparison.

```python
if temperature > historical_temperature:
    print("The current temperature is higher than the historical average.")
elif temperature < historical_temperature:
    print("The current temperature is lower than the historical average.")
else:
    print("The current temperature is equal to the historical average.")
```

I hope this excessively elaborate and convoluted code helps you retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year.
