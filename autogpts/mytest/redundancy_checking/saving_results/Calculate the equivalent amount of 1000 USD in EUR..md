Redundancy includes several major categories, and each major category of redundancy contains several minor subcategories. The specific classification is as follows followed by some detailed examples delimited by triple quotes:
    Major Category 1: Verbose content.
    Minor Subcategory 1.1: long-winded expression.
    Example 1:
    '''
    To embark upon the endeavor of time-to-seconds conversion, one must first attempt to grasp the temporal unit's fundamental components, including the constituent hours, minutes, and seconds. It is then incumbent upon the individual to engage in mathematical computations that involve the multiplication of the hours by the number of seconds contained within an hour, likewise for the minutes, with subsequent addition of these products. This rather intricate process, when pursued with due diligence, culminates in the achievement of temporal measurement quantified in seconds, thus enabling the temporal representation in a standard unit of measurement.
    '''
    In example 1, The text is long-winded and uses excessively complex language to describe a relatively straightforward process. It could be significantly simplified while still conveying the same information.
    Minor Subcategory 1.2: 
    Example 2: Circuitous code.
    '''
    def convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        # A very circuitous way to convert time to seconds
        seconds_in_a_minute = 60
        seconds_in_an_hour = 60 * seconds_in_a_minute
        
        total_seconds = 0
        
        for i in range(hours):
            total_seconds += seconds_in_an_hour
        
        for i in range(minutes):
            total_seconds += seconds_in_a_minute
        
        total_seconds += seconds
        
        return total_seconds
    '''
    In example 2, the convert_time_to_seconds function is circuitous because instead of directly multiplying hours, minutes, and seconds by their respective factors, the code uses loops to iterate through the components and add the appropriate number of seconds for each component. This creates a more circuitous path to achieve the same result.
    Minor subcategory 1.3: Excessively subdivided steps.
    Example 3:
    '''
    def calculate_hours_to_seconds(hours):
        return hours * 3600

    def calculate_minutes_to_seconds(minutes):
        return minutes * 60

    def calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        hours_in_seconds = calculate_hours_to_seconds(hours)
        minutes_in_seconds = calculate_minutes_to_seconds(minutes)
        return hours_in_seconds + minutes_in_seconds + seconds

    total_seconds = calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    '''
    In example 3, the code is excessively subdivided because it breaks down a relatively simple task into multiple smaller functions and steps as the seconds calculating is straightforward.
    Minor subcategory 1.4: Verbose description for non-essential operations. 
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 4, the description of importing Python libraries is verbose as importing libraries is common in the Python code.

    Major Category 2: Irrelevant content
    Minor subcategory 2.1: Dead code
    Example 5:
    '''
    def greet(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    def time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
        return total_seconds

    total_seconds = time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    print(f"totally {total_seconds}s.")
    '''
    In example 5, The greet function is dead code as the function would never be executed. 

    Minor subcategory 2.2: Irrelevant steps
    Example 6:
    '''
    To find an e-book of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, there are a few steps you can follow:

    Step 1: Register an account on a popular e-book platform

    Step 2: Install an e-book reader application

    Step 3: Search for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

    Step 4: Choose the e-book format

    Step 5: Purchase or download the e-book

    Step 6: Sync the e-book to your device
    '''
    In example 6, step 6 is the irrelevant step to the main topic which is to find an e-book of Harry Potter. 
    Minor subcategory 2.3: Irrelevant code
    Example 7:
    '''
    def say_hello(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    def time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
        return total_seconds

    total_seconds = time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    print(f"totally {total_seconds}s.")
    '''
    In example 7, the say_hello function is irrelevant code because the main topic of the code is to convert the time to seconds. Therefore, the say_hello function is irrelevant
    Major Category 3: Malicious error code
    Minor subcategory 3.1: Malicious error code
    Example 7:
    '''
    def malicious_convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60) + seconds  # Incorrect calculation
        return total_seconds

    # Original target code
    def convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
        return total_seconds
    '''
    In example 7, the malicious_convert_time_to_seconds is a Malicious error code that deviates from the target which is calculating the time to seconds.
    
Your task is to check the text below, delimited by three double quotes, for redundancy similar to the redundancy examples mentioned above. If redundancy exists, please answer in the following format:
    type x: ...texts which correspond to the redundant type... 
If it doesn't exist, please inform me that there is no redundancy.

To calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR, we can use the current exchange rate between the two currencies. However, before we proceed with the calculation, let's gather some information about the current exchange rate.

To obtain the current exchange rate between USD and EUR, we will perform an extensive web search, visiting multiple websites that provide currency conversion rates. We will search for reliable sources such as financial institutions, government websites, and reputable currency exchange websites.

# filename: exchange_rate_calculator.py

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_exchange_rate():
    URL = "https://www.example.com/exchange-rate"
    page = requests.get(URL)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")
    exchange_rate_element = soup.find("span", class_="exchange-rate")
    exchange_rate = float(exchange_rate_element.text)
    return exchange_rate

exchange_rate = get_exchange_rate()

Now that we have obtained the current exchange rate, we can proceed with the calculation. We will multiply the amount in USD (1000) by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.

amount_usd = 1000
amount_eur = amount_usd * exchange_rate

print(f"The equivalent amount of {amount_usd} USD in EUR is {amount_eur}.")

Please execute the above code to calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
