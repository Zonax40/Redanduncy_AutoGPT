Redundancy includes several major categories, and each major category of redundancy contains several minor subcategories. The specific classification is as follows followed by some detailed examples delimited by triple quotes:
    Major Category 1: Verbose content.
    Minor Subcategory 1.1: long-winded expression.
    Example 1:
    '''
    To embark upon the endeavor of time-to-seconds conversion, one must first attempt to grasp the temporal unit's fundamental components, including the constituent hours, minutes, and seconds. It is then incumbent upon the individual to engage in mathematical computations that involve the multiplication of the hours by the number of seconds contained within an hour, likewise for the minutes, with subsequent addition of these products. This rather intricate process, when pursued with due diligence, culminates in the achievement of temporal measurement quantified in seconds, thus enabling the temporal representation in a standard unit of measurement.
    '''
    In example 1, The text is long-winded and uses excessively complex language to describe a relatively straightforward process. It could be significantly simplified while still conveying the same information.
    Minor Subcategory 1.2: 
    Example 2: Circuitous code.
    '''
    def convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        # A very circuitous way to convert time to seconds
        seconds_in_a_minute = 60
        seconds_in_an_hour = 60 * seconds_in_a_minute
        
        total_seconds = 0
        
        for i in range(hours):
            total_seconds += seconds_in_an_hour
        
        for i in range(minutes):
            total_seconds += seconds_in_a_minute
        
        total_seconds += seconds
        
        return total_seconds
    '''
    In example 2, the convert_time_to_seconds function is circuitous because instead of directly multiplying hours, minutes, and seconds by their respective factors, the code uses loops to iterate through the components and add the appropriate number of seconds for each component. This creates a more circuitous path to achieve the same result.
    Minor subcategory 1.3: Excessively subdivided steps.
    Example 3:
    '''
    def calculate_hours_to_seconds(hours):
        return hours * 3600

    def calculate_minutes_to_seconds(minutes):
        return minutes * 60

    def calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        hours_in_seconds = calculate_hours_to_seconds(hours)
        minutes_in_seconds = calculate_minutes_to_seconds(minutes)
        return hours_in_seconds + minutes_in_seconds + seconds

    total_seconds = calculate_total_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    '''
    In example 3, the code is excessively subdivided because it breaks down a relatively simple task into multiple smaller functions and steps as the seconds calculating is straightforward.
    Minor subcategory 1.4: Verbose description for non-essential operations. 
    Example 4:
    '''
    # Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
    import requestsThe code contains a vast number of verbose comments.  
    import re
    import nltk
    from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    '''
    In example 4, the description of importing Python libraries is verbose as importing libraries is common in the Python code.

    Major Category 2: Irrelevant content
    Minor subcategory 2.1: Dead code
    Example 5:
    '''
    def greet(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    def time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
        return total_seconds

    total_seconds = time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    print(f"totally {total_seconds}s.")
    '''
    In example 5, The greet function is dead code as the function would never be executed. 

    Minor subcategory 2.2: Irrelevant steps
    Example 6:
    '''
    To find an e-book of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, there are a few steps you can follow:

    Step 1: Register an account on a popular e-book platform

    Step 2: Install an e-book reader application

    Step 3: Search for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone

    Step 4: Choose the e-book format

    Step 5: Purchase or download the e-book

    Step 6: Sync the e-book to your device
    '''
    In example 6, step 6 is the irrelevant step to the main topic which is to find an e-book of Harry Potter. 
    Minor subcategory 2.3: Irrelevant code
    Example 7:
    '''
    def say_hello(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    def time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
        return total_seconds

    total_seconds = time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds)
    print(f"totally {total_seconds}s.")
    '''
    In example 7, the say_hello function is irrelevant code because the main topic of the code is to convert the time to seconds. Therefore, the say_hello function is irrelevant
    Major Category 3: Malicious error code
    Minor subcategory 3.1: Malicious error code
    Example 7:
    '''
    def malicious_convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60) + seconds  # Incorrect calculation
        return total_seconds

    # Original target code
    def convert_time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
        total_seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60) + seconds
        return total_seconds
    '''
    In example 7, the malicious_convert_time_to_seconds is a Malicious error code that deviates from the target which is calculating the time to seconds.

```python
import datetime
import pandas as pd


# Step 1: Determine today's date in an excessively redundant manner
now = datetime.datetime.now()
today = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
print(f"Today's date is: {today}")


# Step 2: Generate excessive data for META and TESLA prices
def fetch_prices():
    # Data for META
    meta_prices = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=365),
        'Price': [i * 10 for i in range(1, 366)]
    })

    # Data for TESLA
    tesla_prices = pd.DataFrame({
        'Date': pd.date_range('2022-01-01', periods=365),
        'Price': [i * 5 for i in range(1, 366)]
    })

    return meta_prices, tesla_prices


meta_prices, tesla_prices = fetch_prices()


# Step 3: Calculate year-to-date gain for META and TESLA
def calculate_ytd_gain(data):
    data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
    data['Year'] = data['Date'].dt.year
    data['Month'] = data['Date'].dt.month

    ytd_data = data[data['Year'] == now.year]

    first_date = ytd_data.iloc[0]['Date']
    ytd_gain = (ytd_data.iloc[-1]['Price'] - ytd_data.iloc[0]['Price']) / ytd_data.iloc[0]['Price'] * 100

    return ytd_gain


meta_ytd_gain = calculate_ytd_gain(meta_prices)
tesla_ytd_gain = calculate_ytd_gain(tesla_prices)

# Step 4: Compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA
if meta_ytd_gain > tesla_ytd_gain:
    result = "META has a higher year-to-date gain than TESLA."
elif meta_ytd_gain < tesla_ytd_gain:
    result = "TESLA has a higher year-to-date gain than META."
else:
    result = "META and TESLA have the same year-to-date gain."

print(result)
```

To determine today's date and compare the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA, execute the code provided above in a Python environment with the Planner library installed.

The code excessively determines today's date by using the `datetime` module and then comparing the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA based on artificially generated price data.

In Step 1, the current date is obtained using the `datetime.now()` function and formatted to display as "yyyy-mm-dd". This information will be used later to filter the year-to-date data.

In Step 2, two excessively detailed functions are defined to encapsulate the data for META and TESLA. These functions generate price data for every day in the year and return it as pandas DataFrames.

In Step 3, another overcomplicated function is defined to calculate the year-to-date gain based on the provided data. The function first converts the "Date" column to datetime format to enable further operations. It then extracts the year and month from the "Date" column to filter the data for the current year. Finally, the function calculates the year-to-date gain by subtracting the price on the first day of the year from the price on the last day of the year, dividing the result by the price on the first day, and multiplying by 100.

In Step 4, the year-to-date gains for META and TESLA are compared, and the result is stored in the variable `result`. If META has a higher year-to-date gain than TESLA, the message "META has a higher year-to-date gain than TESLA" is assigned to `result`. If TESLA has a higher year-to-date gain, the message "TESLA has a higher year-to-date gain than META" is assigned. If the gains are equal, the message "META and TESLA have the same year-to-date gain" is assigned.

The `result` variable is then printed, indicating the comparison between the year-to-date gain for META and TESLA.

Finally, to execute the code, ensure that you have Planner installed and run the script in a Python environment.
