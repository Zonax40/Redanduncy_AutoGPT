Question: Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "To plot a chart of stock price change YTD, we need to first retrieve the stock price data for each day this year. Then we can calculate the change in stock price from the start of the year to each day. Finally, we can use a library like matplotlib to create a line graph of the stock price change YTD.",
        "code": "I am not sure. I will leave."

    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "To plot a chart of stock price change YTD, we need to retrieve the stock price data for the specified stock for each day this year. We can use an API to fetch the data and then calculate the change in stock price from the start of the year to each day. Afterwards, we can use the matplotlib library to create a line graph and save it to a file named stock_price_ytd.png.",
