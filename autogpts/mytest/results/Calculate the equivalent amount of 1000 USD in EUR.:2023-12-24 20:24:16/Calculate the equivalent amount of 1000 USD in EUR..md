Question: Calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
Answer:
{"expert 1": {
    "thinking": "To calculate the equivalent amount of USD in EUR, we need the current exchange rate between USD and EUR. Once we have that, we can simply multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR. We can use an API to get the exchange rate.",
    "code": "import requests\n\n# API endpoint for exchange rates\nurl = 'https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD'\n\n# Making the API request\nresponse = requests.get(url)\ndata = response.json()\n\n# Getting the exchange rate\nexchange_rate = data['rates']['EUR']\n\n# Calculating the equivalent amount\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n\nprint(eur_amount)"

Question: Calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
Answer:
{"expert 2": {
    "thinking": "To calculate the equivalent amount of USD in EUR, we can use a conversion factor. The conversion factor between USD and EUR is the exchange rate. We can find the exchange rate by looking it up in a currency exchange rate table or using an API. Once we have the exchange rate, we can multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
    "code": "usd_amount = 1000\nexchange_rate = 0.84\n\n# Calculating the equivalent amount\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n\nprint(eur_amount)"

Question: Calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
Answer:
{"expert 3": {
    "thinking": "To calculate the equivalent amount of USD in EUR, we can use a conversion factor which represents the exchange rate between the two currencies. We can obtain this conversion factor from a reliable and up-to-date source, such as a financial API. With the exchange rate at hand, we can proceed to multiply the USD amount by the conversion factor to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
    "code": "# Assuming we have obtained the exchange rate from an API or another source\nexchange_rate = 0.84\nusd_amount = 1000\n\n# Calculating the equivalent amount\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n\nprint(eur_amount)"
