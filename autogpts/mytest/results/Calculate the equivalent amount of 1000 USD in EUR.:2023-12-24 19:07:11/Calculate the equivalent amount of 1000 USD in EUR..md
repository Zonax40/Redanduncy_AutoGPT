Question: Calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "First, we need to check the current exchange rate between USD and EUR. We can use an API to get the latest exchange rate. Then, we can multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "import requests\n\n# Make a request to the API to get the exchange rate\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD')\n\n# Get the exchange rate from the response\nexchange_rate = response.json()['rates']['EUR']\n\n# Calculate the equivalent amount in EUR\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n\nprint(eur_amount)"
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "To calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR, we can use the conversion rate between USD and EUR. Let's assume the exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.85 EUR. We can multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "usd_amount = 1000\nexchange_rate = 0.85\n\n# Calculate the equivalent amount in EUR\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n\nprint(eur_amount)"
    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "We can use a financial data provider to get the current exchange rate between USD and EUR. Once we have the exchange rate, we can multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "import pandas_datareader as pdr\n\n# Get the exchange rate between USD and EUR\nexchange_rate = pdr.get_data_fred('DEXUSEU')\nexchange_rate = exchange_rate['DEXUSEU'].iloc[-1]\n\n# Calculate the equivalent amount in EUR\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n\nprint(eur_amount)"

Question: Calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "Since the code provided by Expert 1 executed successfully and returned a result of 908.0, we can conclude that the code is correct and the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR is 908.0.",
        "code": ""
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "The code provided by Expert 2 executed successfully and returned a result of 850.0. However, this result is based on an assumed exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.85 EUR. If the actual exchange rate is different, the result may not be accurate.",
        "code": ""
    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "The code provided by Expert 3 resulted in an error because the pandas_datareader module is not installed. This module is used to retrieve financial data, including exchange rates. To fix this error, the module needs to be installed using pip install pandas_datareader.",
