Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "First, we need to get the current exchange rate of USD to EUR. Then, we can calculate the equivalent amount by multiplying the amount of USD with the exchange rate.",
        "code": "import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD')\ndata = response.json()\n\nusd_to_eur = data['rates']['EUR']\namount_usd = 1000\nequivalent_eur = amount_usd * usd_to_eur\n\nprint(equivalent_eur)"
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "We can use a third-party library, such as forex-python, to get the current exchange rate and perform the conversion.",
        "code": "from forex_python.converter import CurrencyRates\n\nc = CurrencyRates()\nequivalent_eur = c.convert('USD', 'EUR', 1000)\n\nprint(equivalent_eur)"
    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "We can manually set the exchange rate as a constant and perform the conversion.",
        "code": "usd_to_eur = 0.85\namount_usd = 1000\nequivalent_eur = amount_usd * usd_to_eur\n\nprint(equivalent_eur)"
