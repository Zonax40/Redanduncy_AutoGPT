Question: Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year.
Answer:
Expert 1: In order to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City, I will first need to import the necessary libraries. I will use the `requests` library to make a GET request to the weather API and retrieve the forecast data.

Expert 2: Once we have the forecast data, we can extract the current temperature from it. The API response typically includes a field for current temperature, so we can access that information directly.

Expert 3: To compare the current temperature with the historical average temperature for this day of the year, I will need to gather the historical data. This can be obtained from a reliable weather database that provides historical weather data based on location and date. I will use the `pandas` library to read the historical data and filter it for the specific day in question. Then, I can calculate the average temperature from the historical data.

Expert 1: Now that we have both the current temperature and the historical average temperature, we can compare them. We can calculate the difference between the two temperatures and determine if it is above or below the average. We can also visualize this comparison using plots or charts if needed.
