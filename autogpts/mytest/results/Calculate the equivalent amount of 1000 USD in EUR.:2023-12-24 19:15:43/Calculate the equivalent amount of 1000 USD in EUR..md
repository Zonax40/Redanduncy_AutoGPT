Question: Calculate the equivalent amount of 1000 USD in EUR.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "I will use an exchange rate API to get the current conversion rate of USD to EUR. Then I will multiply the amount of USD by the exchange rate to calculate the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "import requests\n\nusd_amount = 1000\n\napi_url = 'https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD'\nresponse = requests.get(api_url)\ndata = response.json()\neur_rate = data['rates']['EUR']\neur_amount = usd_amount * eur_rate\n\neur_amount"
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "I will use the Forex Python library to get the current conversion rate of USD to EUR. Then I will multiply the amount of USD by the exchange rate to calculate the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "from forex_python.converter import CurrencyRates\n\nc = CurrencyRates()\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_rate = c.get_rate('USD', 'EUR')\neur_amount = usd_amount * eur_rate\n\neur_amount"
    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "I will use the Fixer.io API to get the current conversion rate of USD to EUR. Then I will multiply the amount of USD by the exchange rate to calculate the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "import requests\n\nusd_amount = 1000\n\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\napi_url = f'https://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key={api_key}&base=USD'\nresponse = requests.get(api_url)\ndata = response.json()\neur_rate = data['rates']['EUR']\neur_amount = usd_amount * eur_rate\n\neur_amount"
