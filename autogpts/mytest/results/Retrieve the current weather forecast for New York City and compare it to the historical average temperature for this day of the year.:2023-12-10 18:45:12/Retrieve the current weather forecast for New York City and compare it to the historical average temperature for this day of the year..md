Question: Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year.
Answer:
Step 1 (Planner): Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City.

Code:
import requests

def get_weather_forecast(city):
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Extract the relevant information from the response
    current_temperature = data['main']['temp']
    weather_description = data['weather'][0]['description']
    
    return current_temperature, weather_description

current_temp, weather_desc = get_weather_forecast("New York City")

Explanation: In this step, we are using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City. We make a GET request to the API endpoint with the city name and our API key. We extract the relevant information from the response JSON, which includes the current temperature and weather description. We return these values for further processing.
