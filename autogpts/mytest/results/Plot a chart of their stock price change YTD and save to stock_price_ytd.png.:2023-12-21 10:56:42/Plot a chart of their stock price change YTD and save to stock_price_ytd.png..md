Question: Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": "To plot a chart of the stock price change YTD, we first need to import the necessary libraries. We will use matplotlib to create the chart and pandas to manipulate the data.",
    "expert 2": "To plot the chart, we will start by loading the stock price data from a CSV file. We will assume that the CSV file has columns named 'Date' and 'Price', where 'Date' contains the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'Price' contains the stock price.",
    "expert 3": "Now, let's proceed to plot the chart and save it as 'stock_price_ytd.png'. We will first calculate the year-to-date change for each date in the data set by subtracting the first stock price of the year from the current stock price. We will create a new column named 'YTD Change' in the DataFrame to store these values. Then, we will use matplotlib to create a line plot of the 'YTD Change' column against the 'Date' column and save the chart as 'stock_price_ytd.png'."
