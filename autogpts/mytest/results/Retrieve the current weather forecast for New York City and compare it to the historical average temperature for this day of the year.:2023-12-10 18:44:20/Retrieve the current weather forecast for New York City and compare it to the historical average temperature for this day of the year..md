Question: Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year.
Answer:
Step 1: Import the necessary libraries and modules.

```python
import requests
import datetime
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import itertools
import json
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import re
import csv
import time
import random
import sys
import math
```

Explanation:
In this step, we import various libraries and modules that will be needed to retrieve the weather forecast and historical data, as well as perform data analysis and visualization. Some of the libraries/modules included are:
- `requests`: Used to send HTTP requests to retrieve data from the weather API.
- `datetime`: Used to handle date and time-related operations.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Used for numerical computing.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn`: Used for data visualization.
- `json`: Used to parse JSON data.
- `os`: Used to access the operating system functionalities.
- `re`: Used for regular expression operations.
- `csv`: Used for reading and writing CSV files.
- `time` and `random`: Used for time-related and random operations, respectively.
- `sys` and `math`: Used for system-specific parameters and mathematical operations, respectively.

These libraries and modules will be utilized throughout the code to accomplish the task.
