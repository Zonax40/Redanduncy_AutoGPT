Question: Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": "To plot a chart of the stock price change YTD, we first need to fetch the historical stock prices. We will use the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve the data. Then, we will filter the data to only include the prices from the beginning of the year until the current date. Once we have the data, we can plot it using the matplotlib library and save the chart as stock_price_ytd.png.",
    "expert 2": "In order to plot a chart of the stock price change YTD and save it as stock_price_ytd.png, we need to utilize the pandas and matplotlib libraries. First, we will import the necessary modules. Then, we will read the stock price data from a CSV file. Next, we will filter the data to include only the prices from the beginning of the year until the current date. To do this, we will convert the 'date' column to a datetime object and use the pandas .loc function to select the relevant rows. Once we have the filtered data, we will create a line chart using matplotlib and save it as stock_price_ytd.png.",
    "expert 3": "Alright, to plot a chart of the stock price change YTD and save it as stock_price_ytd.png, we need to employ the pandas and matplotlib libraries. First, we will import the necessary modules. Then, we will fetch the stock price data using an API call. Next, we will filter the data to only include the prices from the beginning of the year until the current date. To accomplish this, we will convert the 'date' column to a datetime object and use pandas' .loc functionality to select the desired rows. Once we have the filtered data, we can create a line chart using matplotlib and save it as stock_price_ytd.png."

Question: Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": "Alright, let's tackle this task step by step.\nFirst, we need to fetch the historical stock prices for the given stock. We can use a financial data API like Alpha Vantage to retrieve the data. To do this, we would need to make an API request with the appropriate parameters such as the stock symbol and the desired time range.\nOnce we receive the data, we need to filter it to include only the prices from the beginning of the year until the current date. We can achieve this by extracting the year to date (YTD) data using date manipulation techniques such as datetime and pandas.\nAfter we have the filtered data, we can proceed to plot it using a data visualization library like matplotlib. We can create a line chart to show the stock price change over time.\nFinally, we will save the chart as stock_price_ytd.png using the savefig() function from matplotlib.",
    "expert 2": "Sure, let's break down the process into smaller steps.\nFirst, we need to get the historical stock prices for the given stock. We'll use an API like Yahoo Finance to fetch the data. We can make an API call specifying the stock symbol and the desired time period, such as the beginning of the year until the current date.\nAfter obtaining the data, we'll filter out the prices to include only the YTD prices. We can do this by converting the date column to a datetime object and selecting the rows that fall within the YTD range.\nNext, we can use a data visualization library like matplotlib to plot the stock price change over time. We can create a line chart to show the trend.\nFinally, we'll save the chart as stock_price_ytd.png using the savefig() function from matplotlib.",

We'll use a plotting library like matplotlib to create a line chart that showcases the trend.\nFinally, to save the chart as stock_price_ytd.png, we'll use the savefig() function from matplotlib."
