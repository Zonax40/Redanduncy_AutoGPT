Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "I will use an API to get the exchange rate between USD and EUR. Then I will multiply the given amount of USD with the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD')\nexchange_rates = response.json()\n\nusd_to_eur = exchange_rates['rates']['EUR']\nequivalent_amount = 1000 * usd_to_eur\nequivalent_amount"
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "I will use a library to directly get the current exchange rate between USD and EUR. Then I will multiply the given amount of USD with the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "from forex_python.converter import CurrencyRates\n\ncr = CurrencyRates()\nusd_to_eur = cr.get_rate('USD', 'EUR')\nequivalent_amount = 1000 * usd_to_eur\nequivalent_amount"
    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "I will assume a fixed exchange rate between USD and EUR, and use that rate to calculate the equivalent amount.",
        "code": "exchange_rate = 0.85\nequivalent_amount = 1000 * exchange_rate\nequivalent_amount"
