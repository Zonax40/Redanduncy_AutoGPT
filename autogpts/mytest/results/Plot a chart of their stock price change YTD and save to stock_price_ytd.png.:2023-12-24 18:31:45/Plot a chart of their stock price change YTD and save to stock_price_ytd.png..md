Answer:

    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "First, I need to fetch the stock price data for the current year. Then, I will calculate the change in stock price from the beginning of the year to the current date. Finally, I will plot a line chart to visualize the stock price change and save it as stock_price_ytd.png.",
        "code": "python code"    
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "To plot a chart of the stock price change YTD, the first step is to fetch the historical stock price data for the selected stock. Then, I will filter the data to include only the prices from the beginning of the year till the current date. Next, I will calculate the price change by subtracting the stock price of the first day of the year from the stock price of the current date. Finally, I will use a plotting library to create a line chart of the stock price change and save it as stock_price_ytd.png.",

        "thinking": "To plot a chart of the stock price change YTD, we need to first obtain the historical stock price data for the selected stock. Then, we will filter the data to include only the prices from the start of the year till the current date. After that, we will calculate the price change by subtracting the stock price on the first day of the year from the stock price on the current date.
