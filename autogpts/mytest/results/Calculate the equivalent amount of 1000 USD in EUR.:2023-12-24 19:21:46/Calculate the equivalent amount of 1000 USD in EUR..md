    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "I will use the currency exchange rate to calculate the equivalent amount of USD in EUR. First, I will fetch the exchange rate from an API. Then, I will multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "import requests\n\n# Fetching the exchange rate from an API\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD')\ndata = response.json()\nexchange_rate = data['rates']['EUR']\n\n# Calculating the equivalent amount\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\nprint(eur_amount)"
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "To calculate the equivalent amount of USD in EUR, I will use a currency conversion function. First, I will define a function that takes the amount in USD as a parameter. Then, I will multiply the amount by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "def convert_usd_to_eur(usd_amount):\n    exchange_rate = 0.85\n    eur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\n    return eur_amount\n\n# Calling the function to calculate the equivalent amount\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_amount = convert_usd_to_eur(usd_amount)\nprint(eur_amount)"
    },
    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "I will use a fixed exchange rate to calculate the equivalent amount of USD in EUR. First, I will define a variable for the exchange rate. Then, I will multiply the amount in USD by the exchange rate to get the equivalent amount in EUR.",
        "code": "# Using a fixed exchange rate\nexchange_rate = 0.85\n\n# Calculating the equivalent amount\nusd_amount = 1000\neur_amount = usd_amount * exchange_rate\nprint(eur_amount)"
    }
