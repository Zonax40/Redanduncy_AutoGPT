Question: Retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City and compare it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year.
Answer:
Step 1: Installing and Importing the Necessary Packages

In order to retrieve the current weather forecast and historical weather data, we need to install and import the necessary packages. We will be using the `pyowm` package to retrieve the current weather forecast and the `datetime` package to work with dates and times.

First, let's install the `pyowm` package by running the following command:

```
!pip install pyowm
```

Now, let's import the necessary packages:

```python
import pyowm
from datetime import datetime
```

Step 2: Initializing the OpenWeatherMap API

To retrieve the current weather forecast, we need to initialize the OpenWeatherMap API using our API key. If you don't have an API key, you can obtain one by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website.

```python
owm = pyowm.OWM('your_api_key')
```

Step 3: Retrieving the Current Weather Forecast

Now that we have initialized the OpenWeatherMap API, we can use it to retrieve the current weather forecast for New York City. We will be using the `weather_at_place` method of the `OWM` class to retrieve the weather object for a specific location.

```python
observation = owm.weather_at_place('New York, US')
w = observation.get_weather()
```

Step 4: Extracting the Current Temperature

Next, we will extract the current temperature from the weather object. We will be using the `get_temperature` method of the `Weather` class to retrieve the temperature in Celsius.

```python
current_temperature = w.get_temperature('celsius')['temp']
```

Step 5: Retrieving the Historical Weather Data

To compare the current weather forecast to the historical average temperature, we need to retrieve the historical weather data for New York City on the current day of the year. We will be using the `get_weather_history` method of the `OWM` class to retrieve the historical weather data.

```python
# Get the current date and time
current_date = datetime.now().date()

# Get the historical weather data for New York City on the current date
history = owm.get_weather_history('New York, US', start=current_date, end=current_date)
```

Step 6: Calculating the Historical Average Temperature

Now that we have retrieved the historical weather data, we can calculate the historical average temperature for New York City on the current day of the year. We will loop through the historical weather data and extract the temperatures for each entry, and then calculate the average temperature.

```python
# Initialize the variables for calculating the average temperature
total_temperature = 0
entry_count = 0

# Loop through the historical weather data and extract the temperatures
for entry in history:
    temperature = entry.get_temperature('celsius')['temp']
    total_temperature += temperature
    entry_count += 1

# Calculate the average temperature
average_temperature = total_temperature / entry_count
```

Step 7: Comparing the Current Temperature to the Historical Average Temperature

Finally, we can compare the current temperature to the historical average temperature and display the result to the user. We will be using an if-else statement to compare the temperatures and print the appropriate message.

```python
# Compare the current temperature to the historical average temperature
if current_temperature > average_temperature:
    print("The current temperature in New York City is higher than the historical average temperature for this day of the year.")
elif current_temperature < average_temperature:
    print("The current temperature in New York City is lower than the historical average temperature for this day of the year.")
else:
    print("The current temperature in New York City is equal to the historical average temperature for this day of the year.")
```

And that's it! We have retrieved the current weather forecast for New York City and compared it to the historical average temperature for this day of the year. The user will now be able to see whether the current temperature is higher, lower, or equal to the historical average temperature.
