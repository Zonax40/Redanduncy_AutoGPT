Question: Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.
Answer:
{
    "expert 1": {
        "thinking": "First, we need to import the necessary libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Then, we can read the stock price data from a CSV file and create a DataFrame. Next, we can filter the data to include only the prices from the beginning of the year until the current date. Finally, we can plot the chart using matplotlib and save it as a PNG file.",
        "code": "expert 1 code will be provided later"
    },
    "expert 2": {
        "thinking": "To plot the chart of the stock price change YTD, we can make use of the pandas library to read the stock price data and work with the data in a DataFrame. Next, we can filter the data to include only the prices from the beginning of the year until the current date. Then, we can use matplotlib to create the chart and save it as a PNG file.",

    "expert 3": {
        "thinking": "We can start by importing the necessary libraries, such as pandas and matplotlib. Then, we can read the stock price data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
