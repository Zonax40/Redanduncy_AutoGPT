Question: Plot a chart of their stock price change YTD and save to stock_price_ytd.png.
Answer:
Expert 1 (Python Expert): First, we need to import the necessary libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, and datetime.

Expert 2 (Python Expert): Next, we need to read the stock price data from a CSV file or fetch it from an API using pandas.

Expert 3 (Python Expert): Then, we need to clean the data by converting any date column to a datetime data type and sorting the data by date.

Expert 1 (Python Expert): Afterwards, we can calculate the year-to-date (YTD) stock price change by subtracting the stock price on the first day of the year from the current stock price.

Expert 2 (Python Expert): Additionally, we can create a line plot or candlestick chart using matplotlib to visualize the YTD stock price change.

Expert 3 (Python Expert): Finally, we can save the chart as an image file, such as stock_price_ytd.png, using the savefig() function in matplotlib.
